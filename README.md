Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

Bonus:

Add time-based scoring
Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.

A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Technologies used:
1. html - for structure
2. CSS - for style
3. JS - behavior

Approach:
Broke down project into pseudo code and then broke each section into smaller projects to tackle.
Worked on HTML first laying down the structure of the page.
Added JS and CSS to enable behavior and style.

Instructions:
User must first click on "New Game" button and enter their name.
Once the game starts, the user has to make one selection from a set of 4 radio buttons. The score is continuously visible to the user even on scrolling the page
At the end of the game the score is shown.
The user has the option to click"Record you Score" button anytime to save their score.
At any time the user can click the "Give up" button to see the correct answers.
A small reset button exists at the bottom of the page to clear the local storage where player name and scores are saved.

Unsolved problems:
I wanted to make the code more DRY. But had trouble re-using my function to display questions and so re-used the whole function code again. I will learn and fix this!!
Was unable to get to the bonus timer part.
